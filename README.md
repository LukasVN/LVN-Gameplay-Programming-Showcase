# LVN Gameplay Programming Showcase

Welcome to the public repository for the **LVN Gameplay Programming Showcase** series. This series focuses on recreating gameplay mechanics and core systems in **Unreal Engine (C++ and Blueprints)** and **Unity (C#)**, with an emphasis on clean, engine-agnostic code design and functional prototypes.

---

## Repository Structure

Each mechanic has its own folder containing:

- **C# scripts** for Unity implementations  
- **C++ scripts** for Unreal Engine implementations  
- **Blueprint screenshots** for Unreal visual scripting examples  
- Optional **notes or diagrams** explaining implementation or design decisions  

This structure allows you to explore each mechanic individually without needing a full project.

---

## Usage Notes

These scripts demonstrate the mechanics themselves, but **do not include full engine setup instructions**. To recreate or use any of these mechanics in your own project, some connections or configurations may be required (e.g., assigning input actions, linking components, or setting up camera rigs).  

The focus is on **showcasing gameplay logic**, not providing ready-to-run projects.

---

## Future Plans

If multiple mechanics form a cohesive project in the future, I may:

- Upload the **entire project** showing the mechanics working together  
- Provide additional **tutorials or walkthroughs** for specific systems  

The goal is to demonstrate the ability to implement mechanics across engines and languages while maintaining clean, modular, and adaptable code.

## How to Explore

1. Browse the folders for the mechanic you are interested in  
2. Inspect scripts or Blueprint screenshots  
3. Use them as reference, inspiration, or to study clean gameplay programming patterns  

---

## Disclaimer

These examples are **functional prototypes**, not full polished games. Each entry focuses on mechanics, code structure, and engine-agnostic principles.
